Genome-plus-transcriptome sequencing (G\u0026T-seq) enables characterizing the DNA and RNA of the same single cell in parallel.  In this project, six special breast tumors were profiled for the first time using 10X RNA sequencing and G\u0026T-seq: one polymorphous carcinoma, one secretory carcinoma and one bone-, one chondroid-, and two myxoid-matrix producing metaplastic carcinomas. We were able to computationally identify the normal and cancer cell states based on their genomic and transcriptomic profiles. The DNA copy number landscape of the polymorphous and the matrix producing carcinomas are highly rearranged and disclosed clear genetic alterations present in subclonal populations of cells. None of the rearrangements observed in the matrix producing carcinomas, were shared between tumors. No aberrations were observed in the secretory carcinoma, in accordance with literature.  At the transcriptomic level we found the presence of fibroblasts, endothelial and immune cells, in addition to the cancerous cells. The identification of specific marker genes and pathways, as well as the integration with pathology information is ongoing. Lastly, we were able to unambiguously study for the first time the effect of DNA copy number state on the transcriptome in breast tumors using G\u0026T-seq.","tags":["Cancer","Single-cell","Multi-omics"],"title":"Single-Cell Multi-Omics Sequencing to Understand the Nature, Extent and Biology of Cellular Heterogeneity in Six Special Breast Cancer Cases","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1540302834,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1540302834,"objectID":"c13169b86dda9f79e9d6b10f1cce7416","permalink":"https://svanuytven.github.io/talk/trainmalta/","publishdate":"2018-10-23T15:53:54+02:00","relpermalink":"/talk/trainmalta/","section":"talk","summary":"Short introduction and general review of single-cell multi-omics techniques developed by the research groups of Professor Voet","tags":["Cancer","Single-cell","Multi-omics","Development","Workshop"],"title":"Single-cell multi-omics to detect genetic variants in cancer and development","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1525867841,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1525867841,"objectID":"ffc98bdcfdbae59ea97d2b210a3a6f62","permalink":"https://svanuytven.github.io/talk/rsgsymposium2018/","publishdate":"2018-05-09T14:10:41+02:00","relpermalink":"/talk/rsgsymposium2018/","section":"talk","summary":"Breast cancer tumors consist of different subpopulations of cells with potentially distinctive properties such as treatment-resistance and metastatic potential.

Clinical trials held over the past two decades have proven that this approach is effective in curing genetic disorders and can produce better results than the standard therapy (Touzot, F et al., 2015). Nevertheless, adverse events in a limited number of patients treated with gamma-retroviral vectors have deterred their widespread application. Specifically, vector integration occurring in proximity of proto-oncogenes resulted in insertional mutagenesis and clonal expansion of the cells (Hacein-Bey-Abina S et al., 2003).","tags":["Gene Therapy","Bioinformatics"],"title":"Studying BET protein-chromatin occupation to understand genotoxicity of MLV-based gene therapy vectors","type":"talk"}]
