	abstract = {The frequent acquisition of genomic abnormalities in human preimplantation embryos is a leading cause of pregnancy loss, but does not necessarily prohibit healthy offspring. However, the impact of genomic abnormalities on cellular states and development of the early human embryo remains largely unclear. Here, we characterise aneuploidy and reconstruct gene regulatory networks in human preimplantation embryos, and investigate gene expression and developmental perturbations instigated by aneuploidy using single-cell genome-and-transcriptome sequencing (G\&amp;T-seq). At the genomic level, we show that acquired numerical and structural chromosomal aberrations are frequent across all stages of early embryogenesis and in all cell lineages. At the transcriptome level, we identify regulators of cell identity and uncover a network of 248 transcription factors from 10 major gene regulatory modules that characterise the distinct lineages of human preimplantation embryos. By integrating single-cell DNA-with RNA-information, we unveil how expression levels are affected by losses or gains of the corresponding genes in embryonic cells across human preimplantation development, as well as how copy-number aberrant transcription factor genes perturb the expression of their cognate target genes in euploid regions. Furthermore, we reveal a majority of aneuploid cells show a developmental delay and reduced fitness, indicating cell competition within the mosaic diploid-aneuploid embryo, which may contribute to selection against aneuploid cells and the birth of healthy offspring from mosaic diploid-aneuploid embryos. In summary, our multi-modal analyses provide unprecedented insights into early human embryo development.Competing Interest StatementT.V. and J.R.V are co-inventors on licensed patents WO/2011/157846 (Methods for haplotyping single cells); WO/2014/053664 (High-throughput genotyping by sequencing low amounts of genetic material); WO/2015/028576 (Haplotyping and copy number typing using polymorphic variant allelic frequencies).},
