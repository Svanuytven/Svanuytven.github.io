	abstract = {Single-cell multi-omics methods are enabling the study of cell state diversity, which is largely determined by the interplay of the genome, epigenome, and transcriptome. Here, we describe Gtag\&amp;T-seq, a genome-and-transcriptome sequencing (G\&amp;T-seq) protocol of the same single cells that omits whole-genome amplification (WGA) by using direct genomic tagmentation (Gtag). Gtag drastically decreases the cost and improves coverage uniformity at both the single-cell and pseudo-bulk level when compared to WGA-based G\&amp;T-seq. We also show that transcriptome-based DNA copy number inference has limited resolution and accuracy, underlining the importance of affordable multi-omic approaches. Moreover, applying Gtag\&amp;T-seq to a melanoma xenograft model before treatment and at minimal residual disease revealed differential cell state plasticity and treatment response between cancer subclones. In summary, Gtag\&amp;T-seq is a low-cost and accurate single-cell multi-omics method enabling the exploration of genetic alterations and their functional consequences in single cells at scale.Competing Interest StatementT.V. is co-inventor on licensed patents WO/2011/157846 (Methods for haplotyping single cells); WO/2014/053664 (High-throughput genotyping by sequencing low amounts of genetic material); WO/2015/028576 (Haplotyping and copy number typing using polymorphic variant allelic frequencies).},
