	abstract = {Recent advances in spatial omics methods are revolutionising biomedical research by enabling detailed molecular analyses of cells and their interactions in their native state. As most technologies capture only a specific type of molecules, there is an unmet need to enable integration of multiple spatial-omics datasets. This, however, presents several challenges as these analyses typically operate on separate tissue sections at disparate spatial resolutions. Here, we established a spatial multi-omics integration pipeline enabling co-registration and granularity matching, and applied it to integrate spatial transcriptomics, mass spectrometry-based lipidomics, single nucleus RNA-seq and histomorphological information from human prostate cancer patient samples. This approach revealed unique correlations between lipids and gene expression profiles that are linked to distinct cell populations and histopathological disease states and uncovered molecularly different subregions not discernible by morphology alone. By its ability to correlate datasets that span across the biomolecular and spatial scale, the application of this novel spatial multi-omics integration pipeline provides unprecedented insight into the intricate interplay between different classes of molecules in a tissue context. In addition, it has unique hypothesis-generating potential, and holds promise for applications in molecular pathology, biomarker and target discovery and other tissue-based research fields.Competing Interest StatementCompeting Financial Interests: A.L., and M.J.Q.M. are employed by Aspect Analytics NV.
